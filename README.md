# Software/Hardware interface

In this project, an LPC1768 based hardware is connecting to MATLAB Simulink blocks, developed separately based on Arduino IO library, to provide IO and DC motor control with low latency through ethernet communication.
The codes are also benefited by some of the available resources on the Landtiger developement board with LPC1768 chip.


The peripherals are:

1 - Analog to Digital Converters  
2 - Digital Inputs  
3 - Digital Outputs  
4 - Encoder Read  
5 - PWM DC Motor Drivers  
6 - PWM Write  
7 - Ethernet TCP/IP Connection  
8 - USB Interface
